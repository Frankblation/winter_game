##  ðŸŒ²IntroductionðŸŒ²


### Is a winter themed 2D side scroller video game that's based of evading and puzzle solving.

### We used Godot and GDscript to create this game. We used Adobe Photoshop to create and edit backgrounds and sprite sheets. This was our first introduction to creating games and we had a lot of fun!
